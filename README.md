It was very hard for me to work with clerk authentication. Due to issues with my laptop I was a bit behind from my lessons.
I also had lots of issues regarding fs,dns,etcs.. after user sign-up with clerk components(realised using as client where i it dosen't required).
Not able to achieve what I wanted to but try to finish +1 day from actual deadline thanks to Manny for understanding and guiding/helping me though.

I just checked my deployed assignment and clerk sign-up is not working so try to use sign-in with this details:
